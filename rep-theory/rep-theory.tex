    \chapter{Representation Theory of the Symmetric Group}
    \label{chap:reps of Sn}
    \section{Combinatoric Preliminaries}
    The representation theory of the symmetric group, \(S_n\), is mostly controlled by the combinatorics of partitions.
    In this section we set up some of the important objects which allow for efficient computations with representations of \(S_n\).
    
    \begin{dfn}{Partition}{}
        Let \(n\) be a nonnegative integer.
        A \defineindex{partition} of \(n\) is a nonincreasing sequence of nonnegative integers, \(\lambda = (\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3, \dotsc)\), such that \(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \lambda_3 + \dotsb = n\).
    \end{dfn}
    
    \begin{ntn}{}{}
        We write \(\lambda \partition n\) to say that \(\lambda\) is a partition of \(n\).
        
        We write \(\abs{\lambda}\) for \(n\).
        
        We write \(\ell(\lambda)\) for the number of nonzero parts, that is \(\lambda_\ell\) is the last nonzero term in the sequence \(\lambda\).
    \end{ntn}
    
    Notice that since \(n\) is finite and \(\lambda\) is nonincreasing it must be that \(\lambda_i = 0\) for \(i\) sufficiently large, so usually we'll just consider \(\lambda\) as a finite sequence.
    For example, there are \(7\) partitions of \(5\):
    \begin{equation*}
        (5), \quad (4, 1), \quad (3, 2), \quad (3, 1, 1), \quad (2, 2, 1) \quad (2, 1, 1, 1), \qand (1, 1, 1, 1, 1).
    \end{equation*}
    
    The number of partitions of \(n\), often denoted \(p(n)\), grows pretty quickly.
    For \(n = 0, \dotsc, 15\) \(p(n)\) is given by [\hyperlink{https://oeis.org/A000041}{OEIS A000041}]
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{array}{r|rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr}
            n & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15\\ \hline
            p(n) & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 7 & 11 & 15 & 22 & 30 & 42 & 56 & 77 & 101 & 135 & 176
        \end{array}
    \end{equation*}
    
    Listing numbers makes it hard to spot patterns, and isn't very natural for some of the definitions we want to give.
    Most work with partitions is done with a graphical notation, known as Young diagrams.
    
    \begin{dfn}{Young Diagrams}{}
        For a partition, \(\lambda\), of \(n\), the corresponding \define{Young diagram}\index{Young!diagram}, also denoted \(\lambda\), is made of \(n\) boxes arranged in a left-aligned grid with \(\lambda_i\) boxes in the \(i\)th row.
    \end{dfn}
    
    For example, the Young diagrams of the partitions of \(5\) listed above are
    \ytableausetup{smalltableaux}
    \begin{equation*}
        \ydiagram{5}\,,\quad \ydiagram{4,1}\,,\quad \ydiagram{3,2}\,,\quad \ydiagram{3,1,1}\,,\quad \ydiagram{2,2,1}\,,\quad \ydiagram{2,1,1,1}\,,\qand \ydiagram{1,1,1,1,1}\,.
    \end{equation*}
    
    On their own Young diagrams are nice, but the real power comes when we start putting things in the boxes.
    In theory these could be anything, but the following definition gives the most useful case for us.
    
    \begin{dfn}{Young Tableaux}{}
        Let \(\lambda\) be a partition of \(n\).
        A \define{Young tableau}\index{Young!tableau} (pl.\@ tableaux) of shape \(\lambda\) is a filling of the boxes of \(\lambda\) with the numbers \(1, \dotsc, n\).
        Write \(Y(\lambda)\) for the set of boxes in \(\lambda\), then a Young tableau of shape \(\lambda\) is precisely a function \(T \colon Y(\lambda) \to \{1, \dotsc, n\}\).
        \begin{wrn}
            The lectures assume that \(T\) is a bijection, I think this is a bad assumption, since semistandard Young tableaux are pretty important.
        \end{wrn}
    \end{dfn}
    
    Not all Young tableaux of a given shape are equally important when it comes to representation theory.
    The following definition gives the most common restrictions on Young tableaux.
    
    It is useful to index the boxes by their position in the Young diagram.
    This is done with \enquote{matrix index} rules, we start at the top left corner with \((1, 1)\), going one box right gives \((1, 2)\), and one box down gives \((2, 1)\).
    That is, we index with row number followed by column number.
    
    \begin{dfn}{}{}
        Let \(\lambda\) be a partition, and \(T\) a Young tableau of shape \(\lambda\).
        Then we say that \(T\) is \define{semistandard}\index{semistandard tableau} if
        \begin{equation}
            T(i, j) \le T(i, j + 1) \qqand T(i, j) < T(i + 1, j).
        \end{equation}
        That is, a semistandard tableau has weakly increasing rows and strictly increasing columns.
        We say that \(T\) is \define{semistandard}\index{semistandard tableau} if \(T \colon Y(\lambda) \to \{1, \dotsc, n\}\) is a bijection and in addition
        \begin{equation}
            T(i, j) < T(i, j + 1) \qqand T(i, j) < T(i + 1, j).
        \end{equation}
        That is, a standard tableau has strictly increasing rows and strictly increasing columns and every number from \(1\) to \(n\) appears exactly once.
    \end{dfn}
    
    \begin{rmk}
        Some authors call any not-necessarily-bijective filling of a Young diagram with any alphabet a Young tableau, others assume that all Young tableau are at least semistandard, so you have to be careful about conventions.
    \end{rmk}
    
    Consider the partition \(\lambda = (3,2)\).
    The following are all standard Young tableau of shape \(\lambda\) with labels in \(\{1, \dotsc, 5\}\):
    \begin{equation}
        \ytableaushort{123,45}\,,\quad \ytableaushort{124,35}\,,\quad \ytableaushort{125,34}\,,\qand\ytableaushort{134,25}\,.
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{ntn}{}{}
        We write \(\standardYoungTableaux(\lambda)\) for the set of all standard Young tableaux of shape \(\lambda\).
    \end{ntn}
    
    The number of standard tableaux of any partition of \(n\), that is
    \begin{equation}
        \sum_{\lambda \partition n} \abs{\standardYoungTableaux(\lambda)},
    \end{equation}
    for \(n\) from \(0\) to \(15\) is given by [\hyperlink{https://oeis.org/A000085}{OEIS A000085}]
    \begin{gather*}
        1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 76, 232, 764, \num{2620}, \num{9496}, \num{35696},\\
        \num{140152}, \num{568504}, \num{2390480}, \num{10349536}.
    \end{gather*}
    This is also the number of involutions in \(S_n\) (\cref{exm:number of involutions in Sn}) a fact that will follow from \cref{thm:frobenius schur} once we have identified the relationship between standard Young tableaux and irreducible representations of \(S_n\) in the next section.
    
    \section{Constructing Simple \texorpdfstring{\(S_n\)}{Sn}-Modules}
    \subsection{Row and Column Groups}
    Fix some partition, \(\lambda\), of \(n\), and let the tableau \(T \colon Y(\lambda) \to \{1, \dotsc, n\}\) be a bijective filling of the boxes of \(\lambda\).
    
    \begin{dfn}{Canonical Tableau}{}
        The \defineindex{canonical tableau} of shape \(\lambda\) is the filling given by assigning the numbers \(1\) through \(n\) in order going from left to right, top to bottom.
    \end{dfn}
    
    For example, the canonical tableau of shape \((3, 2)\) is
    \begin{equation}
        \ytableaushort{123,45}\,.
    \end{equation}
    
    \begin{dfn}{Row and Column Groups}{}
        There is a natural action of \(S_n\) on any bijective filling of boxes, simply permute the numbers as usual.
        That is, if \(w \in S_n\) and \(T(i, j) = k \in \{1, \dotsc, n\}\) then \(w \action T\) is the Young tableau of shape \(\lambda\) with \((w \action T)(i, j) = w(k) = w(T(i, j))\).
        
        The \defineindex{row group} of a Young tableau, \(T\), is the subgroup, \(\rowGroup_T\), of \(S_n\) which acts by permuting elements within rows without permuting elements between columns.
        Similarly, the \defineindex{column group} of a Young tableau, \(T\), is the subgroup, \(\columnGroup_T\), of \(S_n\) which acts by permuting elements within columns without permuting elements between rows.
    \end{dfn}
    
    \begin{rmk}
        The lecture notes, and some other literature uses \(P_T\) and \(Q_T\) for the row and column group.
        I can't ever remember which is which, so I've changed it to \(\rowGroup\) and \(\columnGroup\).
    \end{rmk}
    
    It is common to write \(\rowGroup_\lambda\) and \(\columnGroup_\lambda\) for the row and column group of the canonical tableau, \(T_0\).
    
    Explicitly, we have
    \begin{equation}
        \rowGroup_T = \{w \in S_n \mid T^{-1}(w(T(i, j))) \text{ is in row } i\}
    \end{equation}
    and
    \begin{equation}
        \columnGroup_T = \{w \in S_n \mid T^{-1}(w(T(i, j))) \text{ is in column } j\}.
    \end{equation}
    Since the action of the row group is always to permute rows for a Young tableau with \(\ell\) rows we can identify that
    \begin{equation}
        \rowGroup_n \isomorphic S_{\lambda_1} \times S_{\lambda_2} \times \dotsb \times S_{\lambda_\ell} \eqcolon S_\lambda
    \end{equation}
    for \(\lambda = (\lambda_1, \dotsc, \lambda_\ell)\).
    In this \(S_{\lambda_i}\) acts by permuting boxes in the \(i\)th row, which has, by definition, \(\lambda_i\) boxes.
    Before we can make a similar identification for \(\columnGroup_T\) we need the notion of the transpose of a Young diagram.
    
    \begin{dfn}{Transpose}{}
        Let \(\lambda\) be a Young diagram.
        Its \defineindex{transpose}, \(\lambda'\), is the Young diagram given by reflecting along the main diagonal.
        This can be extended to Young tableau, simply transpose the underlying diagram and keep the corresponding numbering, so \(T'(i, j) = T(j, i)\).
    \end{dfn}
    
    For example, if \(\lambda = (3, 2)\) then \(\lambda' = (2, 2, 1)\), or in terms of Young diagrams,
    \begin{equation}
        \lambda = \ydiagram{3,2} \implies \lambda' = \ydiagram{2,2,1}\,.
    \end{equation}
    
    Since the transpose swaps rows and columns of a Young diagram we can see that it swaps row and column groups, so \(\rowGroup_{T'} = \columnGroup_T\) and \(\columnGroup_{T'} = \rowGroup_T\).
    Thus, we can identify that
    \begin{equation}
        \columnGroup_T = S_{\lambda_1'} \times S_{\lambda_2'} \dotsb \times S_{\lambda_{\ell}'} = S_{\lambda'}.
    \end{equation}
    
    \subsection{Symmetrisers, Antisymmetrisers, and Projectors}
    \begin{dfn}{Symmetrisers, Antisymmetrisers and Projectors}{}
        Given a partition, \(\lambda\), let \(T_0\) be the corresponding canonical tableau.
        We define three elements of \(\field S_n\):
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The \define{Young symmetriser}\index{Young!symmetriser} is
            \begin{equation}
                a_\lambda \coloneq \frac{1}{\abs{\rowGroup_{T_0}}} \sum_{w \in \rowGroup_{T_0}} w.
            \end{equation} 
            \item The \define{Young antisymmetriser}\index{Young!antisymmetriser} is
            \begin{equation}
                b_\lambda = \frac{1}{\abs{\columnGroup_{T_0}}} \sum_{w \in \columnGroup_{T_0}} \sgn(w) w.
            \end{equation}
            \item The \define{Young projector}\index{Young!projector} is
            \begin{equation}
                c_\lambda = a_\lambda b_\lambda.
            \end{equation}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{dfn}
    
    For example, consider \(\lambda = (2, 1)\).
    The row group is \(\{\cycle{}, \cycle{1,2}\}\), simply permuting the entries of the first row.
    The column group is also \(\{\cycle{}, \cycle{1,3}\}\), permuting the entries of the first column.
    Thus,
    \begin{equation}
        a_\lambda = \frac{1}{2}[\cycle{} + \cycle{1,2}), \qand b_\lambda = \frac{1}{2}(\cycle{} - \cycle{1,3}].
    \end{equation}
    Then\footnote{I'm making a decision here that permutations multiply by acting on something to their right, so they multiply to give a left action of \(S_n\).}
    \begin{equation}
        c_\lambda = \frac{1}{4}[\cycle{} + \cycle{1,2} - \cycle{1,3} - \cycle{1,3,2}].
    \end{equation}
    
    For any vector space, \(V\), there is a natural action of \(S_n\) on \(V^{\otimes n}\), permuting the factors.
    This is where the names above come from.
    For example, if \(\lambda = (3) = \ydiagram{3}\) then \(\rowGroup_{T_0} = S_3\) and
    \begin{equation}
        a_{(3)} = \frac{1}{6}[cycle{} + \cycle{1,2} + \cycle{1,3} + \cycle{2,3} + \cycle{1,2,3} + \cycle{1,3,2}]
    \end{equation}
    and the action on \(v_1 \otimes v_2 \otimes v_3 \in V^{\otimes 3}\) is
    \begin{multline}
        v = a_{\ydiagram{3}} \action (v_1 \otimes v_2 \otimes v_3) = \frac{1}{6}(v_1 \otimes v_2 \otimes v_3 + v_2 \otimes v_1 \otimes v_3 + v_3 \otimes v_2 \otimes v_1\\
        + v_1 \otimes v_3 \otimes v_2 + v_2 \otimes v_3 \otimes v_1 + v_3 \otimes v_1 \otimes v_1).
    \end{multline}
    This is then symmetric in the sense that \(w \action v = v\).
    Similarly, if
    \begin{equation}
        \lambda = (1,1,1) = \ydiagram{1,1,1}
    \end{equation}
    then \(\columnGroup_{T_0} = S_3\),
    \begin{equation}
        b_{(1,1,1)} = \frac{1}{6}[\cycle{} - \cycle{1,2} - \cycle{1,3} - \cycle{2,3} + \cycle{1,2,3} + \cycle{1,3,2}]
    \end{equation}
    and
    \begin{multline}
        v = b_{(1,1,1)} \action (v_1 \otimes v_2 \otimes v_3) = \frac{1}{6}(v_1 \otimes v_2 \otimes v_3 - v_2 \otimes v_1 \otimes v_3 - v_3 \otimes v_2 \otimes v_1\\
        - v_1 \otimes v_3 \otimes v_2 + v_2 \otimes v_3 \otimes v_1 + v_3 \otimes v_1 \otimes v_1).
    \end{multline}
    This is then antisymmetric in the sense that \(w \action v = \sgn(w)v\).
    
    One way of looking at this is that \(a_{(3)}\) projects \(V^{\otimes 3}\) to the subspace on which \(S_n\) acts trivially, whereas \(b_{(1,1,1)}\) projects \(V^{\otimes 3}\) onto the subspace where \(S_n\) acts by the sign representation.
    In general, we have \(a_{(n)}V^{\otimes n} = S^nV\) and \(b_{(1,\dotsc,1)}V^{\otimes n} = \Lambda^nV\).
    
    \subsection{Specht Modules}
    \begin{dfn}{Specht Module}{}
        For \(\lambda\) a partition of \(n\) we call the module \(V_\lambda \coloneq \field S_n c_\lambda\) the \defineindex{Specht module}.
    \end{dfn}
    
    \begin{remark}{}{}
        Our definition here is rather abstract.
        A more direct definition of the Specht modules is via \define{tabloids}\index{Young!tabloid}, which are equivalence classes of Young tableau, \(\{T\}\), under the action of the row group.
        That is, two Young tableau are equivalent if we can get from one to the other by permuting elements within a row.
        The column group acts on these tabloids by permuting elements between different rows, note that these elements now no longer need to be in the same column, since we can always move elements freely within rows of a tableau without leaving the equivalence class.
        Then for a tableau, \(T\), we define the formal linear combination of equivalence classes
        \begin{equation}
            E_T = \sum_{w \in \columnGroup_T} \sgn(w)[w \action T].
        \end{equation}
        Doing this for all \emph{standard} Young tableau of shape \(\lambda\), we declare the resulting \(E_T\) to be a basis for some vector space, \(V\).
        There is an action of the symmetric group on \(V\), defined on this basis by
        \begin{equation}
            \sigma \action E_T = \sum_{w \in \columnGroup_T} \sgn(w)[\sigma w \action T].
        \end{equation}
        For \(T\) of shape \(\lambda\) it turns out that \(V\) under this action is isomorphic to \(V_\lambda\).
        The idea is that we are able to freely move about in a row, because we've symmetrised over rows in the Specht module, and we're able to move between rows at the cost of a sign, because we've antisymmetrised over columns in a Specht module, and here we have the sign appearing in the sum over the column group.
    \end{remark}
    
    Elements of these modules are of the form \(xc_\lambda\) for some \(x \in \field S_n\).
    The action of \(S_n\) on such an element is simply multiplication, \(w \action x c_\lambda = wxc_\lambda\).
    These are modules since the action is determined by the action on \(\field S_n\), the \(c_\lambda\) is not involved since it is on the right.
    
    \begin{exm}{}{}
        Consider \(S_3\).
        There are three partitions, \((3)\), \((1,1,1)\), and \((2,1)\).
        We've already seen \(a_{(3)}\), \(b_{((1,1,1))}\), \(a_{(2,1)}\) and \(b_{(2,1)}\).
        It's also clear that \(a_{(1,1,1)} = \cycle{}\) and \(b_{(3)} = \cycle{}\).
        Computing the projectors we have
        \begin{align}
            c_{(3)} &= \frac{1}{6}[\cycle{} + \cycle{1,2} + \cycle{1,3} + \cycle{2,3} + \cycle{1,2,3} + \cycle{1,3,2}]\\
            c_{(1,1,1)} &= \frac{1}{6}[\cycle{} - \cycle{1,2} - \cycle{1,3} - \cycle{2,3} + \cycle{1,2,3} + \cycle{1,3,2}]\\
            c_{(2,1)} &= \frac{1}{4}[\cycle{} + \cycle{1,2} - \cycle{1,3} - \cycle{1,3,2}].
        \end{align}
        
        We have the linear map \(\complex S_n \to \complex S_n c_\lambda\) given by \(x \mapsto xc_\lambda\).
        To compute the modules \(\complex S_n c_\lambda\) it is sufficient to look at the basis of \(\complex S_n\), which is of course just \(S_n\).
        The image of the basis under \(x \mapsto xc_\lambda\) is then a spanning set of \(\complex S_n c_\lambda\).
        Taking any maximal linearly independent subset of this spanning set then gives a basis of \(\complex S_n c_\lambda\).
        
        Starting with \(\lambda = (3)\) we can see that \(wc_{(3)} = c_{(3)}\), thus \(V_{(3)} = \Span\{c_\lambda\}\) is a one-dimensional space.
        Since \(w c_{(3)} = c_{(3)}\) for all \(w \in S_3\) we can also see that \(S_n\) acts trivially on \(V_{(3)}\) and so \(V_{(3)}\) is the trivial representation.
        In general, \(V_{(n)}\) is always the trivial representation of \(S_n\).
        
         Now consider \(\lambda = (1,1,1)\).
         We have
         \begin{equation}
             \cycle{} c_{(1,1,1)} = \cycle{1,2,3} c_{(1,1,1)} = \cycle{1,3,2} c_{(1,1,1)}
         \end{equation}
         and
         \begin{equation}
             \cycle{1,2} c_{(1,1,1)} = \cycle{1,3} c_{(1,1,1)} = \cycle{2,3} c_{(1,1,1)} = -c_{(1,1,1)}.
         \end{equation}
         Thus, we have \(V_{(1,1,1)} = \Span\{c_{(1,1,1)}\}\), again a one-dimensional space.
         However, this time we have that \(w \in S_3\) acts as its sign, since from the above we see that \(w c_{(1,1,1)} = \sgn(w)c_{(1,1,1)}\).
         Thus, \(V_{(1,1,1)}\) is the sign representation.
         In general, \(V_{(1,\dotsc,1)}\) is always the sign representation of \(S_n\).
         
         Finally, consider \(\lambda = (2,1)\).
         We then have
         \begin{gather}
             \cycle{} c_{(2,1)} = \cycle{1,2}c_{(2,1)} = c_{(2,1)};\\
             \cycle{1,3} c_{(2,1)} = \cycle{1,2,3} c_{(2,1)}\\
             \quad = \frac{1}{4}[-\cycle{} + \cycle{1,3} - \cycle{2,3} + \cycle{1,2,3}]; \notag\\
             \cycle{2,3} c_{(2,1)} = \cycle{1,3,2} c_{(2,1)}\\
             \quad = \frac{1}{4}[-\cycle{1,2} + \cycle{2,3} - \cycle{1,2,3} + \cycle{1,3,2}]. \notag
         \end{gather}
         These are not all linearly independent, we have that
         \begin{equation}
             \label{eqn:linear dependence between elements of 21 specht module}
             \cycle{2,3}c_{(2,1)} = -c_{(2,1)} - \cycle{1,3} c_{(2,1)}.
         \end{equation}
         Thus, we have \(V_{(2,1)} = \Span\{c_{(2,1)}, \cycle{1,3}c_{(2,1)}\}\), so this is a \(2\)-dimensional representation.
         For the action of \(S_n\) on \(V_{(2,1)}\) we can use relationships like \cref{eqn:linear dependence between elements of 21 specht module} and
         \begin{equation}
             \cycle{2,3}\cycle{1,3}c_{(2,1)} = \cycle{1,2,3}c_{(2,1)} = \cycle{1,3}c_{(2,1)}
         \end{equation}
         to compute that
         \begin{equation}
             \rho(\cycle{2,3}) = 
             \begin{pmatrix}
                 -1 & 0\\
                 -1 & 1
             \end{pmatrix}
         \end{equation}
         when we use the ordered basis \(\{c_{(2,1)} = (1, 0)^{\trans}, \cycle{1,3}c_{(2,1)} = (0, 1)^{\trans}\}\).
         Note that the columns of the matrix are just the image of the basis vectors under the action of \(\cycle{2,3}\).
         Similar calculations give
         \begin{gather}
             \rho(\cycle{}) = 
             \begin{pmatrix}
                 1 & 0\\
                 0 & 1
             \end{pmatrix}
             , \quad \rho(\cycle{1,2}) = 
             \begin{pmatrix}
                 1 & -1\\
                 0 & -1
             \end{pmatrix}
             , \quad \rho(\cycle{1,3}) = 
             \begin{pmatrix}
                 0 & 1\\
                 1 & 0
             \end{pmatrix}
             , \notag\\
             \rho(\cycle{1,2,3}) =
             \begin{pmatrix}
                 0 & -1\\
                 1 & -1
             \end{pmatrix}
             ,
             \qand \rho(\cycle{1,3,2}) =
             \begin{pmatrix}
                 -1 & 1\\
                 -1 & 0
             \end{pmatrix}
             .
         \end{gather}
         It's the a straightforward calculation to check that this is indeed a representation of \(S_n\), simply check that \(\rho\) defines a homomorphism \(S_n \to \generalLinear_2\).
         
         Of course, actually doing these calculations by hand for \(n\) much larger than \(3\) becomes very arduous pretty quickly, which is why a large chunk of my masters project was programming these calculations\footnote{See \url{https://github.com/WilloughbySeago/MphysReport} for the report, and \url{https://github.com/WilloughbySeago/MPhysProjectCode} for the code.}.
    \end{exm}
    
    The bases of the Specht modules in the above example were \(\{c_{(3)}\}\), \(\{c_{(1,1,1)}\}\), and \(\{c_{(2,1), \cycle{1,3}c_{(2,1)}}\}\).
    It is actually possible to work out what these will be without having to do the calculations above.
    For a fixed shape, \(\lambda\), there is always a basis of \(V_\lambda\) consisting of all \(wc_\lambda\) such that \(w \action T_0\) is a standard tableau.
    For the \(n = 3\) case this corresponds to the only standard tableau being
    \begin{equation}
        \ytableaushort{123}\,,\quad \ytableaushort{1,2,3},=\,,\quad \ytableaushort{12,3}\,,\qand \ytableaushort{13,2}\,.
    \end{equation}
    The dimension of \(V_\lambda\) is thus the number of standard tableau of shape \(\lambda\).
    That is,
    \begin{equation}
        f^\lambda \coloneq \dim V_\lambda = \abs{\standardYoungTableaux(\lambda)}.
    \end{equation}
    
    Fortunately, there is a nice rule for computing this number.
    First, we define the \define{hook length}\index{hook!length} of a box in a Young diagram to be the number of boxes to the right, plus the number of boxes below, plus one for the box itself.
    The idea is that this is the length of the \enquote{hooks} as depicted below for \(\lambda = (3,2)\):
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{ytableau}
            *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80)\\
            *(highlight!80) & \mathstrut
        \end{ytableau}
        \,,\quad
        \begin{ytableau}
            \mathstrut & *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80)\\
            \mathstrut & *(highlight!80)
        \end{ytableau}
        \,,\quad
        \begin{ytableau}
            \mathstrut & \mathstrut & *(highlight!80) \\
            \mathstrut & \mathstrut
        \end{ytableau}
        \,,\quad
        \begin{ytableau}
            \mathstrut & \mathstrut & \mathstrut\\
            *(highlight!80) \mathstrut & *(highlight!80)
        \end{ytableau}
        \,,\qand
        \begin{ytableau}
            \mathstrut & \mathstrut & \mathstrut\\
            \mathstrut & *(highlight!80) \mathstrut
        \end{ytableau}
        \,.
    \end{equation}
    The hook lengths of the corresponding boxes are then
    \begin{equation}
        \ytableaushort{431,21}\,.
    \end{equation}
    The \define{hook number}\index{hook!number} of a Young diagram, \(\lambda \intterobang\), is then the product of the Hook lengths, so
    \begin{equation}
        \lambda \intterobang = 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 24.
    \end{equation}
    
    It is then a known fact that the number of semistandard tableaux of shape \(\lambda\) with \(n\) boxes, which is also the dimension of the \(S_n\) Specht module, \(V_\lambda\), is given by the \define{hook length formula}\index{hook!length formula}
    \begin{equation}
        f^\lambda = \dim V_\lambda = \abs{\standardYoungTableaux(\lambda)} = \frac{n!}{\lambda \intterobang}
    \end{equation}
    
    \subsection{Specht Modules are Simple}
    In this section we work over \(\complex\).
    Fix some positive integer, \(n\), and partition, \(\lambda \partition n\).
    
    We will show that the Specht modules, \(V_\lambda\), are precisely the simple \(S_n\)-modules.
    The proof is pretty mechanical, and requires some lemmas and a bit more knowledge about Young diagrams first.
    
    \begin{lma}{}{}
        For \(g \in \rowGroup_\lambda\) we have \(a_\lambda g = g a_\lambda\), and for \(g \in \columnGroup_\lambda\) we have \(b_\lambda g = \sgn(g) g b_\lambda\).
    \end{lma}
    
    \begin{lma}{}{lma:sandwhich symmetrisers}
        For \(x \in \complex S_n\) we have \(a_\lambda x b_\lambda = \ell_\lambda(x)c_\lambda\) where \(\ell_\lambda\) is some linear function.
        \begin{proof}
            First note that if \(g \in \rowGroup_\lambda \columnGroup_\lambda\) then \(g = rc\) for some \(r \in \rowGroup_\lambda\) and \(c \in \columnGroup_\lambda\), and so \(a_\lambda g b_\lambda = \sgn(c) c_\lambda\).
            To prove the statement we will show that if \(g \notin \rowGroup_\lambda \columnGroup_\lambda\) then \(a_\lambda g b_\lambda = 0\), since then we can take \(\ell_\lambda(g) = \sgn(c)\) or \(\ell_\lambda(g) = 0\) as appropriate, on the basis, \(S_n\), to define \(\ell_\lambda(x)\) on all of \(\complex S_n\).
            
            To show that \(a_\lambda g b_\lambda = 0\) for \(g \notin \rowGroup_\lambda \columnGroup_\lambda\) it is sufficient to find some transposition, \(\tau\), such that \(\tau \in \rowGroup_\lambda\) and \(g^{-1}\tau g \in \columnGroup_\lambda\).
            Using the fact that \(a_\lambda\) is invariant under the action of \(\rowGroup\) and \(\columnGroup_\lambda\) acts on \(b_\lambda\) by the sign we have
            \begin{align}
                a_\lambda g b_\lambda = a_\lambda \tau g b_\lambda = a_\lambda gg^{-1}\tau gb_\lambda = a_\lambda g(g^{-1}\tau g)b_\lambda = -a_\lambda g b_\lambda
            \end{align}
            which must mean that \(a_\lambda g b_\lambda = 0\).
            
            Finding such a transposition is equivalent to finding two elements in the same row of the tableau \(T\), and in the same column of the tableau \(g \action T\).
            So, our goal is then equivalent to showing that if such a pair doesn't exist then \(g \in \rowGroup_\lambda \columnGroup_\lambda\).
            That is, there exist some \(r \in \rowGroup\) and \(c' \in \columnGroup_{g \action \lambda} = g \columnGroup_\lambda g^{-1}\) such that \(r \action T = c' \action (g \action T)\), and then \(g = rc^{-1}\) where \(c = g^{-1}c'g \in \columnGroup_\lambda\).
            
            Any two elements of the first row of \(T\) are in different columns of \(g \action T\), so there exists some \(c_1' \in \columnGroup_{g \action \lambda}\) such that all of these elements are in the first row.
            Thus, there is some \(r_1 \in \rowGroup_\lambda\) such that \(r_1 \action T\) and \(c_1' \action (g \action T)\) have the same first row.
            Repeating this we can find \(r_2 \in \rowGroup_{r_1 \action \lambda}\) and \(c_2' \in \columnGroup_{c_1'g \action T}\) such that \(r_2r_1 \action T\) and \(c_2'c_1'g \action T\) have the same first two rows.
            Continuing on we will eventually construct the desired \(r\) and \(c'\), since this process will terminate eventually as the tableau has finitely many rows.
        \end{proof}
    \end{lma}
    
    \begin{crl}{}{crl:young projector idempotent up to scalar}
        The Young projector, \(c_\lambda\), is idempotent up to a scalar.
        \begin{proof}
            We have
            \begin{equation}
                c_\lambda^2 = a_\lambda b_\lambda a_\lambda b_\lambda = \ell_\lambda(b_\lambda a_\lambda) c_\lambda
            \end{equation}
            for some scalar \(\ell_\lambda(b_\lambda a_\lambda)\).
        \end{proof}
    \end{crl}
    
    Note that
    \begin{equation}
        \ell_\lambda(b_\lambda a_\lambda) = \frac{n!}{\abs{\rowGroup_\lambda} \abs{\columnGroup_\lambda} \dim V_\lambda} = \frac{\lambda \intterobang}{\abs{\rowGroup_\lambda} \abs{\columnGroup_\lambda}}.
    \end{equation}
    Further, note that from \(c_\lambda\) we can construct an idempotent, \(e = c_\lambda/\sqrt{\ell_\lambda(b_\lambda a_\lambda)}\), so long as \(\ell_\lambda(b_\lambda a_\lambda) \ne 0\), which is true in this case.
    
    \begin{dfn}{Lexicographic Ordering}{}
        We define the \defineindex{lexicographic order} on the set of partitions of \(n\) by declaring that \(\lambda < \mu\) if for the smallest value of \(i\) such that \(\lambda_i \ne \mu_i\) we have \(\lambda_i < \mu_i\).
    \end{dfn}
    
    For example, consider the partitions of \(5\), under the lexicographic ordering we have
    \begin{equation}
        (1,1,1,1,1) < (2,1,1,1) < (2,2,1) < (3,1,1) < (3,2) < (4,1) < (5).
    \end{equation}
    Note that this is the \enquote{dictionary order}.
    When ordering two words we first compare their first two letters, if they're the same we move on to the second two letters, and so on.
    At the first pair of different letters we place first whichever word has the letter appearing earlier in the dictionary.
    
    \begin{lma}{}{lma:a_lambda CSn b_mu zero if lambda > mu}
        If \(\lambda > \mu\) in the lexicographic order then \(a_\lambda \complex S_n b_\mu = 0\).
        \begin{proof}
            Similarly to the previous lemma we just need to show that for any \(g \in S_n\) there is some transposition, \(\tau \in \rowGroup_\lambda\) such that \(g^{-1}\tau g \in \columnGroup_\mu\).
            Let \(T\) be the canonical tableau of shape \(\lambda\) and \(T'\) the tableau we get if we act with \(g\) on the canonical tableau of shape \(\mu\).
            We claim that there are two entries in the same row of \(T\) and same column of \(T'\).
            If \(\lambda_1 > \mu_1\) this follows from the pigeonhole principle, there must be some element of the first row of \(T\) not in the first row of \(T'\), and thus we simply pick whatever element of the first row it sits below as our other element.
            If \(\lambda_1 = \mu_1\) then as we did before we can find \(r_1 \in \rowGroup_\lambda\) and \(c'_1 \in Q_{g \action \mu} = gQ_\mu g^{-1}\) such that \(r_1 \action T\) and \(c_1' \action T'\) have the same first row, then repeat the argument for the second row.
            Eventually, we will reach a row for which \(\lambda_i > \mu_i\), since we have declared \(\lambda > \mu\).
        \end{proof}
    \end{lma}
    
    \begin{lma}{}{lma:idempotent e then Ae -> M iso eM}
        In any algebra, \(A\), with an idempotent, \(e\), any left \(A\)-module, \(M\), is such that \(\Hom_A(Ae, M) \isomorphic eM\).
        \begin{proof}
            The desired isomorphism is \(\varphi \colon eM \to \Hom_A(Ae, M)\), defined by \(\varphi(m) = f_m \colon Ae \to M\) which is the morphism defined by \(f_m(a) = a \action m\).
            
            First note that elements of \(eM\) are of the form \(e \action m\) for some \(m \in M\).
            Then \(eM\) is an \(A\)-module under the action \(a \action (e \action m) = ae \action m\).
            To see this first note that \(ae = \)
            
            To show that this is well-defined we need to show that \(f_m(a) = a \action m\) really is an element of \(eM\).
            That is, we need to show it is of the form \(e \action m'\) for some \(m' \in M\).
            To do this we use the fact that \(a \in Ae\), so \(a = a'e\) for some \(a' \in A\).
            Thus, we have \(f_m(a) = f_m(a'e) = a'e \action m\).
            This is the action of \(a'\) on \(e \action m\), and so 
             
            This is invertible, since given \(f_m\) we can recover \(m\) as \(f_m(1) = 1 \action m = m\).
            This is an \(A\)-module homomorphism since
            \begin{align}
                \varphi(a \action m)(a') &= f_{a \action m}(a')\\
                &= a' \action (a \action m)\\
                &= a'a \action m\\
                &= f_{m}(a'a)\\
                &= (a \action f_m)(a')\\
                &= (a \action \varphi(m))(a').
            \end{align} 
        \end{proof}
    \end{lma}
    
    \begin{thm}{}{}
        The simple \(S_n\)-modules are precisely the Specht modules.
        \begin{proof}
            \Cref{crl:young projector idempotent up to scalar} tells us that \(c_\lambda\) is idempotent up to a scalar, so let \(e_\lambda\) be the idempotent we get by rescaling \(c_\lambda\).
            Note then that \(\complex S_n c_\lambda = \complex S_n e_\lambda\), since we can always absorb any scalar factor with the coefficients in \(\complex\).
            
            Take two partitions, \(\lambda\) and \(\mu\), and without loss of generality suppose that \(\lambda \ge \mu\) in the lexicographic order.
            We have that
            \begin{equation}
                \Hom_{S_n}(V_\lambda, V_\mu) = \Hom_{S_n}(\complex S_n e_\lambda, \complex S_n e_\mu) = e_\lambda \complex S_n e_\mu
            \end{equation}
            by \cref{lma:idempotent e then Ae -> M iso eM} and its obvious left-analogue.
            
            For \(\lambda > \mu\) we have that
            \begin{equation}
                \dim(e_\lambda \complex S_n e_\mu) = 0
            \end{equation}
            For \(\lambda = \mu\) we have
            \begin{equation}
                \dim(e_\lambda \complex S_n e_\lambda) = 1
            \end{equation}
            because tells us that \(e_\lambda \complex S_n e_\lambda\) is spanned by \(c_\lambda g c_\lambda = a_\lambda b_\lambda g a_\lambda b_\lambda\), and by \cref{lma:sandwhich symmetrisers} we know that these elements are of the form \(\ell_\lambda(b_\lambda g a_\lambda) c_\lambda\).
            We also have a flipped version of \cref{lma:sandwhich symmetrisers}, which tells us that there is some linear function, \(\ell'_\lambda\) such that \(b_\lambda x a_\lambda = \ell_\lambda'(x)b_\lambda a_\lambda\).
            Applying this the spanning elements are all of the form
            \begin{equation}
                \ell_\lambda(b_\lambda g a_\lambda) c_\lambda = \ell_\lambda(\ell'_\lambda(g)b_\lambda a_\lambda) c_\lambda = \ell'_\lambda(g)\ell_\lambda(b_\lambda a_\lambda) c_\lambda.
            \end{equation}
            Thus, all elements of \(e_\lambda \complex S_n e_\lambda\) are just a scalar multiple of \(c_\lambda\), so this is a one-dimensional space.
            
            From this we can apply \cref{thm:inner prod of characters is dim of homs}, which tells us that
            \begin{equation}
                \innerprod{\chi_\lambda}{\chi_\mu} = \delta_{\lambda\mu}
            \end{equation}
            So, \cref{thm:inner prod of characters is dim of homs} tells us that \(V_\lambda \ncong V_\mu\) for \(\lambda \ne \mu\), and, \cref{crl:square of of chars 1 iff simple} tells us that \(V_\lambda\) is simple.
            
            To finish off the proof note that the number of simple modules is equal to the number of conjugacy classes (\cref{crl:number of conjugacy classes is number of irreps}), and the conjugacy classes of \(S_n\) are labelled by cycle type, which are themselves partitions of \(n\).
            So, we have bijections
            \begin{equation}
                \{\text{Specht Modules}\} \xleftrightarrow{1:1} \{\lambda \partition n\} \xleftrightarrow{1:1} \Irr(S_n).
            \end{equation}
            Thus, we have exhausted the possible simple modules, so we know that all simple modules are isomorphic to some Specht module.
        \end{proof}
    \end{thm}
    
    \chapter{Branching Rules}
    We have a natural embedding of symmetric groups
    \begin{equation}
        \{e\} = S_1 \hookrightarrow S_2 \hookrightarrow \dotso \hookrightarrow S_{n-1} \hookrightarrow S_n \hookrightarrow \dotso.
    \end{equation}
    This allows us to view each symmetric group as a subgroup of any larger subgroup.
    Specifically, \(S_{n-1}\) can be viewed as the subgroup of \(S_n\) consisting of permutations of \(\{1, \dotsc, n\}\) which leave \(n\) fixed\footnote{We can fix any \(k \in \{1, \dotsc, n\}\), the resulting subgroups are all conjugate, it's just that fixing \(n\) is the most \enquote{natural} choice.}.
    
    In terms of representations this means that any representation of \(S_{n-1}\) can be viewed as the restriction of some representation of \(S_n\).
    Simply forget how any element that doesn't fix \(n\) acts.
    It turns out that the decomposition of such an \(S_{n-1}\)-module into simple \(S_{n-1}\)-modules is particularly simple (no pun intended).
    In a sense every \enquote{possible} simple \(S_{n-1}\)-module appears in the decomposition exactly once.
    What we mean by possible here is that when we take the Young diagram corresponding to the \(S_{n-1}\)-module it should fit inside the Young diagram corresponding to the \(S_n\)-module.
    We make this precise with the following definition.
    
    \begin{dfn}{Skew Diagram}{}
        Let \(\lambda\) and \(\mu\) be partitions such that \(\mu_i \le \lambda_i\) for all \(i\).
        Then we may form the \defineindex{skew diagram}, \(\lambda \setminus \mu\), by placing both diagrams on top of each other and removing any boxes in the overlap.
    \end{dfn}
    
    For example, if we have
    \begin{equation}
        \lambda = \ydiagram{6,4,4,3,2,2,1}\,\qand \mu = \ydiagram{5,4,3,2,1}
    \end{equation}
    then overlapping these we have
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{ytableau}
            *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80) & \mathstrut\\
            *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80)\\
            *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80) & \mathstrut\\
            *(highlight!80) & *(highlight!80) & \mathstrut\\
            *(highlight!80) & \mathstrut\\
            \mathstrut & \mathstrut\\
            \mathstrut
        \end{ytableau}
    \end{equation}
    so the corresponding skew diagram is
    \begin{equation}
        \lambda \setminus \mu = \ydiagram{5+1,4+0,3+1,2+1,1+1,2,1}\,.
    \end{equation}
    Notice that it's possible to have entire rows missing, as we do here.
    This may include rows being cut off from the top or bottom of the diagram, but one should still imagine that they are there, they just have length zero.
    
    If we're considering representations of \(S_n\) and \(S_{n-1}\) then \(\lambda\) must have \(n\) boxes and \(\mu\) must have \(n - 1\) boxes, so \(\lambda\setminus \mu\) (when it exits) must have \(1\) box.
    
    
    \begin{prp}{Branching Rules}{prp:Sn branching rules}
        Let \(V_\lambda\) be a simple \(S_n\) module, so \(\lambda \partition n\).
        Let\footnote{I think it's poor notation not to distinguish between \(S_n\)- and \(S_{n-1}\)-modules in a way that is immediately obvious, but \(V_\lambda\) is always an \(S_{\abs{\lambda}}\)-module, so the notation is not ambiguous.} \(V_\mu\) denote the simple \(S_{n-1}\)-modules, so \(\mu \partition n-1\).
        Then
        \begin{equation}
            \Res^{S_n}_{S_{n-1}} V_\lambda = \bigoplus_{\substack{\mu \partition n-1\\ \abs{\lambda\setminus \mu} = 1}} V_\mu.
        \end{equation}
        In particular, the restriction is multiplicity free.
        \begin{proof}
            \Step{Dimension Sum}
            An \defineindex{inner corner} of a Young diagram is a box that we can remove and still have a (non-skew) Young diagram.
            Consider a standard Young tableau, \(T\), of shape \(\lambda\).
            Since \(T\) is standard \(n\) must appear in the right-most position of whichever row it is in.
            There must also be no box below the box containing \(n\).
            This means that \(n\) is in an inner corner, and so we can remove it, to produce a Young tableau, \(T^-\), with corresponding Young diagram \(\lambda^-\).
            Further, \(T^-\) is still a standard Young tableau, now with \(n-1\) boxes.
            
            In reverse this process shows that any \(n\)-box standard Young tableau may be produced by starting with an \((n-1)\)-box standard Young tableau and adding a single box labelled \(n\).
            Thus, the number of \(n\)-box standard Young tableau of shape \(\lambda\) is precisely the sum of the number of standard Young tableau of shape \(\lambda^-\) as \(\lambda^-\) ranges over all Young diagrams we can produce by removing a single box from \(\lambda\).
            That is,
            \begin{equation}
                f^\lambda = \sum_{\lambda^-} f^{\lambda^-}.
            \end{equation}
            Another way of phrasing that \(\lambda^-\) is \(\lambda\) with a box removed is saying that we're considering all \(\mu\) such that \(\lambda\setminus \mu\) has precisely one box, so
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eqn:number of standard lambda tableaux from number of standard tableaux of one box fewer}
                f^\lambda = \sum_{\substack{\mu \partition n-1\\ \abs{\lambda\setminus \mu} = 1}}.
            \end{equation}
            
            \Step{Module Sum}
            We now want to \enquote{categorify} this result.
            That is, we take the numerical sum,
            \begin{equation}
                f^\lambda = \sum_{\substack{\mu \partition n-1\\ \abs{\lambda\setminus \mu} = 1}} f^\mu,
            \end{equation}
            and we replace the \(f^\lambda\) with objects in some category and the sum with the coproduct.
            We've already seen that \(f^\lambda = \dim V_\lambda\), so the correct choice of objects is the modules, \(V_\lambda\), and the coproduct is then the direct sum.
            Making this replacement on the right we get
            \begin{equation}
                \oplus_{\substack{\mu \partition n-1\\ \abs{\lambda\setminus \mu} = 1}} V_\mu.
            \end{equation}
            We just have to show that this really does correspond to \(\Res^{S_n}_{S_{n-1}}V_\lambda\).
            
            To do this first let \(r_1 < \dotsb < r_k\) be the row numbers for the rows which end with an inner corner.
            Write \(\lambda^i\) for the Young diagram produced by removing the box at the end of row \(r_i\).
            Similarly, if \(T\) is a standard Young tableau with \(n\) placed in the inner corner of row \(r_i\) then write \(T^i\) for the standard Young tableau given by removing this box.
            
            We will construct a flag of vector spaces
            \begin{equation}
                0 = V_0 \subseteq V_1 \subseteq \dotsb \subseteq V_k = V_\lambda.
            \end{equation}
            It is not a coincidence that the maximum index chosen here, \(k\), corresponds to the maximum index of the \(r_i\) before.
            We will do this in such a way that at each step we have \(V_i/V_{i+1} \isomorphic V_{\lambda^i}\) as \(S_{n-1}\)-modules.
            Then we will have that
            \begin{equation}
                \Res^{S_n}_{S_{n-1}} V_\lambda = V_k \isomorphic V_{k-1} \oplus (V_k/V_{k-1}) \isomorphic V_{k-1} \oplus V_{\lambda^k}.
            \end{equation}
            Similarly, we'll have \(V_{k-1} \isomorphic V_{k-2} \oplus V_{\lambda^{k-1}}\), and so
            \begin{equation}
                \Res^{S_n}_{S_{n-1}} V_\lambda \isomorphic V_{k-2} \oplus V_{\lambda^{k-1}} \oplus V_{\lambda^k}.
            \end{equation}
            Continuing on, since the dimension is finite and so our flag has finite length, this process will eventually terminate, and we'll have the desired isomorphism.
            
            All we have to do then is construct such a flag.
            Let \(M_\lambda\) denote the set of Young tabloids of shape \(\lambda\).
            Define a map \(\theta_i \colon M_\lambda \to M_{\lambda^i}\) to be removing \(n\) from row \(r_i\) if its present, and zero otherwise.
            So \(\theta_i(\{T\}) = \{T^i\}\) if \(n\) is in row \(r_i\), and \(\theta_i(\{T\}) = 0\) otherwise.
            These are morphisms of \(S_{n-1}\)-modules, since \(S_{n-1}\) always fixes the box labelled \(n\) and thus the action of \(S_{n-1}\) commutes with removing the box labelled \(n\).
            
            Similarly, we can extend \(\theta_i\) to a map \(V_\lambda \to V_\lambda\) by defining \(\theta_i(E_T) = E_{T^i}\) if \(n\) is in the row \(r_i\), and \(\theta_i(E_T) = 0\) if \(n\) appears in row \(r_j\) with \(j < i\).
            We shall not need the case where \(j > i\), so any definition will work there.
            This is well-defined since any column group action that moves \(n\) from the current row will result in a vanishing term in the expression of \(E_T\).
            The only permutations of the column group which don't send the tabloid to zero under \(\theta_i\) are precisely those which fix the row of \(n\), which means that this subgroup of the column group is precisely \(\columnGroup_{T^i}\).
            
            Note that all standard tabloids, \(E_{T^i} \in V_{\lambda^i}\) are in the image of \(\theta_i\).
            Further, all of these \(E_T\) have their \(n\) in row \(r_i\), and thus we may define \(V_i\) to be the spae spanned by the \(E_{T^i}\).
            Then \(\theta_i(V_i) = V_{\lambda^i}\) as required.
            If \(T\) instead has its \(n\) above row \(r_i\) then \(\theta_i(E_T) = 0\), and thus \(V_{i-1} \subseteq \ker \theta_i\).
            This gives us the chain
            \begin{equation}
                0 = V_0 \subseteq V_1 \cap \ker \theta_1 \subseteq V_1 \subseteq \dotsb \subseteq V_k \cap \ker \theta_k \subseteq V_k = V_\lambda.
            \end{equation}
            We also have
            \begin{equation}
                \dim(V_i/(V_i \cap \ker \theta_i)) = \dim (\theta_i(V_i)) = \dim V_{\lambda^i} = f^{\lambda^i}.
            \end{equation}
            Thus, the steps from \(V_i \cap \ker \theta_i\) to \(V_i\) give us all the \(f^{\lambda^i}\) as we add up the dimensions.
            Thus, by we have accounted for all of \(f^\lambda = \dim V_\lambda\) by \cref{eqn:number of standard lambda tableaux from number of standard tableaux of one box fewer}.
            Thus, the containment \(V_{i-1} \subseteq V_i \cap \ker \theta_i\) is actually an equality, and so we have
            \begin{equation}
                \frac{V_i}{V_{i-1}} = \frac{V_i}{V_i \cap \ker \theta_i} \isomorphic V_{\lambda^i}
            \end{equation}
            as claimed.
        \end{proof}
    \end{prp}
    
    \begin{crl}{}{}
        With notation as in \cref{prp:Sn branching rules} we have
        \begin{equation}
            \Ind^{S_n}_{S_{n-1}} V_\mu = \bigoplus_{\substack{\lambda \partition n\\ \abs{\lambda\setminus \mu} = 1}} V_\lambda.
        \end{equation}
        \begin{proof}
            By Frobenius reciprocity for an arbitrary irreducible character, \(\chi_\nu\), of \(S_{n-1}\) we have
            \begin{equation}
                \innerprod{\chi_\lambda\downarrow^{S_n}_{S_{n-1}}}{\chi_\nu} = \innerprod{\chi_\lambda}{\chi_\nu\uparrow^{S_n}_{S_{n-1}}}.
            \end{equation}
            This tells us that the multiplicity of \(V_\nu\) in \(\Res^{S_n}_{S_{n-1}}V_\lambda\) is the same as the multiplicity of \(V_\lambda\) in \(\Ind^{S_n}_{S_{n-1}}V_\nu\), which is \(1\) if removing a box from \(\lambda\) gives \(\nu\) and zero otherwise, and so the result follows.
        \end{proof}
    \end{crl}
    
    \begin{exm}{}{}
        Consider the \(S_3\)-module \(V_{(2,1)}\).
        In terms of Young diagrams
        \begin{equation}
            \lambda = (2,1) = \ydiagram{2,1}\,.
        \end{equation}
        We can see that
        \begin{equation}
            \Res^{S_3}_{S_2} V_{\ydiagram{2,1}} = V_{\ydiagram{1,1}} \oplus V_{\ydiagram{2}}.
