    \part{Coxeter Groups}
    \chapter{Reflection Groups}
    The recommended reference for this topic is \cite{Humphreys.CoxeterGroups}.
    Throughout this part of the notes \(V\) will always be a real Euclidean space.
    That is, \(V\) is equipped with some positive definite symmetric bilinear form, \(\innerprod{-}{-} \colon V \times V \to \reals\).
    
    \section{Definition}
    \begin{dfn}{Reflection}{}
        Fix some \(\alpha \in V\).
        We say that \(s \in \generalLinear(V)\) is a \define{reflection} along \(\alpha \in V \setminus 0\) if \(s(\alpha) = -\alpha\) and the hyperplane orthogonal to \(\alpha\),
        \begin{equation}
            H_\alpha \coloneq (\reals \alpha)^{\perp} = \{\lambda \in \mid \innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda} = 0\},
        \end{equation}
        is fixed pointwise, so \(s(\lambda) = \lambda\) for \(\lambda \in H_\alpha\), in other words \(s\) acts as the identity on \(H_\alpha\), so \(s|_{H_\alpha} = \id_{H_\alpha}\).
    \end{dfn}
    
    \begin{lma}{}{lma:reflection formula}
        The map defined by
        \begin{equation}
            s_\alpha(\lambda) = \lambda - 2\frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}} \alpha
        \end{equation}
        is a reflection in \(H_\alpha\).
        \begin{proof}
            First note that \(s_\alpha\) is clearly linear
            Then we have
            \begin{equation}
                s_\alpha(\alpha) = \alpha - 2\frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}} \alpha = -\alpha
            \end{equation}
            and if \(\lambda \in H_\alpha\), so \(\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda} = 0\), we simply have
            \begin{equation}
                s_\alpha(\lambda) = \lambda - 2\frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda}} = \lambda.
            \end{equation}
            Finally, \(s_\alpha\) is its own inverse:
            \begin{align}
                s_\alpha(s_\alpha(\lambda)) &= s_\alpha\left( \lambda - 2\frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}}\alpha \right)\\
                &= s_\alpha(\lambda) - 2\frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}}s_\alpha(\alpha)\\
                &= \lambda - 2\frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}}\alpha + 2\frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}}\alpha\\
                &= \lambda. \notag \qedhere
            \end{align}
        \end{proof}
    \end{lma}
    
    Notice that by the definition of \(H_\alpha\) we can always decompose our space as \(V = H_\alpha \oplus \reals \alpha\), so the information about what happens to \(\alpha\) and anything orthogonal to it is enough to fully determine \(s_\alpha\).
    Further, note that any nonzero scalar multiple of \(\alpha\) also determines the same reflection.
    All reflections may be specified in this way, and we'll simply write \(s_\alpha\) for the reflection in the hyperplane orthogonal to \(\alpha\).
    
    \begin{lma}{}{}
        Reflections are orthogonal transformations.
        \begin{proof}
            To show that \(s_\alpha \in \orthogonal(V)\) we need to show that \(\innerprod{s_\alpha(\lambda)}{s_\alpha(\mu)} = \innerprod{\lambda}{\mu}\) for all \(\lambda, \mu \in V\).
            We can do this with the explicit formula above:
            \begin{align}
                \innerprod{s_\alpha(\lambda)}{s_\alpha(\mu)} &= \innerprod*{\lambda - \frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}}\alpha}{\mu - \frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\mu}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}}\alpha}\\
                &= \innerprod{\lambda}{\mu} - 2\frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}}\innerprod{\alpha}{\mu} - 2\frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\mu}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}}\innerprod{\lambda}{\alpha} \\
                &\qquad+ 4\frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda} \innerprod{\alpha}{\mu}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}^2} \innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha} \notag\\
                &= \innerprod{\lambda}{\mu}. \notag\qedhere
            \end{align}
        \end{proof}
    \end{lma}
    
    \begin{dfn}{Reflection Group}{}
        A \define{reflection group} is a group, \(W\), is a subgroup of \(\orthogonal(V)\) generated by reflections.
    \end{dfn}
    
    We will almost entirely restrict our study to finite reflection groups, where \(W\) is a finite group.
    In this part of the notes \(W\) is a finite reflection group unless stated otherwise.
    
    We will see that finite reflection groups are classified by finite type Dynkin diagrams.
    We will write \(W(R)\) for the finite reflection group corresponding to the Dynkin type \(R\) under this correspondence.
    
    \section{Examples}
    \subsection{Dihedral Groups: \texorpdfstring{\(\I[2][m]\)}{I2m}}
    Consider the dihedral group, \(W(\I[2][m]) = \Dih_{m}\), of symmetries of the regular \(m\)-gon.
    Note that this group has order \(2m\).
    We will illustrate things with \(\Dih_5\), the symmetries of the regular pentagon, as seen in \cref{fig:regular pentagon reflections}.
    With \(V = \reals^2\) we can naturally extend the symmetries of the regular \(m\)-gon (centred on the origin) to the entire plane.
    A rotation by \(2\pi/m\) can be generated by two reflections.
    For example, \cref{fig:regular pentagon reflections generate rotations} shows two reflections generating a rotation of \(2\pi/5\) by applying two rotations, and from this we can generate all rotations.

    \subsection{Platonic Solids: \texorpdfstring{\(\A[3]\)}{A3}, \texorpdfstring{\(\B[3]\)}{B3}, \texorpdfstring{\(\H[3]\)}{H3}}
    The platonic solids, the simplex, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron, are the strictest generalisation of regular shapes to three dimensions.
    Like the regular \(m\)-gons the symmetry groups of the platonic solids are all reflection groups upon extending the action from the polyhedron to all of \(\reals^3\).
    
    The 3-simplex, also known as the tetrahedron, has symmetry group \(W(\A[3]) = \Sym_4\), which simply acts by permuting the faces.
    
    The cube and its dual, the octahedron, have \(\Sym_4 \times \integers_2\).
    The \(\integers_2\) corresponds to a reflection in some chosen plane through three non-adjacent vertices, inverting the cube.
    The action of \(\Sym_4\) is to permute the diagonals, which are the lines that are invariant under the different choices of inversion above.
    
    However, it turns out that if we want to generalise in the future it is actually better to think of the symmetries of the cube as being \(W(\B[3]) = \Sym_3 \ltimes \integers_2^3\).
    Here \(\Sym_3\) acts on \(\reals^3\) by permuting the standard basis, and each copy of \(\integers_2\) acts as a reflection in one of the coordinate planes.
    Note that in this description the cube is thought of as \([-1, 1]^3\), centred on the origin.
    
    The dodecahedron has symmetry group \(W(\H[3])\), of order \(120\).
    It's a bit complicated to specify how it acts here, and it also doesn't generalise so we won't go into details.
    
    \subsection{Simplices and Permutations: \texorpdfstring{\(\A[n]\)}{An}}
    The \(n\)-simplex is the convex hull of the \(n\)-basis vectors of \(\reals^{n+1}\).
    This is perhaps a confusing definition, but hopefully the pictures of the \(1\)-, and \(2\)-simplices in \cref{fig:simplices} help.
    The \(1\)-simplex is simply a line segment, the \(2\)-segment is an equilateral triangle, and the \(3\)-simplex is the regular tetrahedron.
    The symmetries of the \(n\)-simplex are simply given by permuting \(n\)-cells (faces of the tetrahedron, edges of the triangle, the two end points of the line), and there are always \(n + 1\) \(n\)-cells.
    The symmetry group of the \(n\)-simplex is thus \(W(\A[n]) = \Sym_{n+1}\).
    
    \begin{figure}

        \end{tikzpicture}
        \caption{Simplices: The \(1\)-simplex is just an interval and the \(2\)-simplex is a triangle.}
        \label{fig:simplices}
    \end{figure}
    
    Recall that \(\Sym_{n+1}\) is generated by transpositions of neighbouring elements, \(\cycle{i,i+1}\) for \(1 \le i \le n\).
    When realised as a reflection group the transposition \(\cycle{i,i+1}\) corresponds to the reflection \(s_{e_i - e_{i+1}}\).
    
    \subsection{Signed Permutations: \texorpdfstring{\(\B[n]\)}{Bn}}
    The \(n\)-cube is \([-1, 1]^n \subset \reals^n\).
    The symmetry group of the \(n\)-cube is the group of \emph{signed} permutations of \(n\)-letters.
    A \define{signed permutation} is a permutation of \(\{-n, -n+1, \dotsc, -1, 1, \dotsc, n-1, n\}\) which preserves pairs \(\{i, -i\}\).
    In other words, it's a combination of some permutation of this set satisfying \(w(-i) = -w(i)\).
    The operation of this group is composition of such permutations.
    A common notation for both signed and unsigned permutations, \(w\), is \([w(1), \dotsc, w(n)]\).
    When using this notation it is common to write \(\overbar{i}\) in place of \(-i\).
    
    For example, \([3, 1, 2]\) is the permutation sending \(1\) to \(3\), \(2\) to \(1\), and \(3\) to \(2\).
    This acts trivially on the negative terms, so it's also just a regular permutation
    In cycle notation it is \(\cycle{1,3,2}\).
    Similarly, \([3, \overbar{1}, 2]\) is the signed permutation sending \(1\) to \(3\), \(2\) to \(-1\), and \(3\) to \(2\).
    The action on \(-1\) is \(w(-1) = -w(1) = -3\), the action on \(-2\) is \(w(-2) = -w(2) = 1\), and finally, the action on \(-3\) is \(w(-3) = -w(3) = -2\).
    So long as \(i\) and \(\overbar{i}\) don't both appear in this notation and no numbers are repeated the result will always be a valid signed permutation.
    If no \(\overbar{i}\)s appear then it's just a normal permutation.
    
    Notice that \(\Sym_n = W(\A[n-1])\) is a subgroup of \(W(\B[n])\), and \(W(\B[n])\) is a subgroup of \(\Sym_{2n} = W(\A[2n-1])\).
    
    As an example of composition consider \(W(\B[3])\).
    We have \([3, \overbar{1}, 2]\) as described above, and also \([\overbar{1}, 2, 3]\) which sends \(1\) to \(-1\) and leaves \(2\) and \(3\) invariant.
    We can determine the composite \([\overbar{1}, 2, 3] [3, \overbar{1}, 2]\) (acting to the right).
    First \(1\) maps to \(3\), then this maps to \(3\).
    Second, \(2\) maps to \(-1\), which then maps to \(1\).
    Finally, \(3\) maps to \(2\), which maps to \(2\).
    Thus, the composite is \([3, 1, 2]\).
    
    One way to think of signed permutations is as acting by first a permutation, \(\sigma\), and then acting as a possible sign change for each term.
    For example, \([3, \overbar{1}, 2]\) is first the permutation \(\sigma = \cycle{1,3,2}\), then the sign change \(({-},{+},{+})\), changing the sign of \(1\) and not \(2\) or \(3\).
    This allows us to encode this as a semidirect product, \(\integers_2^n \rtimes \Sym_n\), in which \(\integers_2^n\) is interpreted as a list of \(n\) signs.
    This is a special case of the more general wreath product, in our case \(\integers_2^n \rtimes \Sym_n = \integers_2 \wr \Sym_n\).
    
    To realise this as a reflection group we again act on \(\reals^n\) by permuting the standard basis with \(\Sym_n\), and then the \(i\)th copy of \(\integers_2\) corresponds to \(s_{e_i}\).
    
    \subsection{Signed Permutations with an Even Number of Sign Changes: \texorpdfstring{\(\D[n]\)}{Dn}}
    The group of signed permutations on \(n\) letters has an index 2 subgroup, \(W(\D[n])\), defined to be the subgroup consisting of all signed permutations which flip an even number of signs.
    This is a reflection group still.
    Taking \(\reals^n\) with the standard basis this group is generated by the \(s_{e_i - e_{i+1}}\) giving the permutations, and the reflections \(s_{e_i + e_j}\) for \(i \ne j\) flipping an even number of signs.
    
    \subsection{Others}
    It turns out that \(W(R)\) represents the symmetries of a \emph{regular} polytope if and only if the Dynkin diagram of \(R\) is \define{simply laced}, that is, each vertex has degree at most \(2\).
    So, \(\A[n]\), \(\B[n]\), \(\G[2]\), \(\F[4]\), \(\H[3]\), \(\H[4]\), and \(\I[2][m]\) all correspond to symmetries of regular polytopes.
    
    We've seen that \(\A[n]\) corresponds to the symmetries of the \(n\)-simplex, \(\B[n]\) the symmetries of the \(n\)-cube, \(\H[3]\) the symmetries of the dodecahedron and \(\I[2][m]\) the symmetries of the regular \(m\)-gon.
    Noting that \(\G[2]\) is just \(\I[2][6]\) we see that \(\G[2]\) corresponds to the symmetries of the regular hexagon.
    
    It's not obvious, but \(\F[4]\) corresponds to the symmetries of a regular \(24\)-cell, a \(4\)-dimensional shape.
    This shape is the convex hull of its vertices, which can be given by either the \(24\) permutations of \((\pm 1, \pm 1, 0, 0) \in \reals^{4}\), or the \(8\) permutations of \((\pm 1, 0, 0, 0)\) and the 16 vertices \((\pm 1/2, \pm 1/2, \pm 1/2, \pm 1/2)\).
    This later description is particularly interesting because if we identify \(\reals^4\) with \(\quaternions\) then we find that these correspond to the Hurwitz quaternions.
    
    Finally, \(\H[4]\) corresponds to the symmetries of the regular \(120\)-cell, another 4-dimensional shape.
    This can similarly be defined as the convex hull of its vertices, but now the vertices are somewhat more complicated to state (there are 600 of them).
    The coordinates of the vertices can be given as all permutations of
    \begin{gather}
        (\pm 2, \pm 2, 0, 0), \quad (\pm \varphi, \pm \varphi, \pm \varphi, \pm \varphi^{-2}), \quad (\pm 1, \pm 1, \pm 1, \pm \sqrt{5}), \notag\\
        \text{and}\quad (\pm \varphi^{-1}, \pm \varphi^{-1}, \pm \varphi^{-1}, \pm \varphi^2)
    \end{gather}
    and all even permutations of
    \begin{equation}
        (0, \pm \varphi^{-1}, \pm \varphi, \pm \sqrt{5}), \quad (0, \pm \varphi^{-2}, \pm 1, \pm \varphi^2), \qand (\pm \varphi^{-1}, \pm 1, \pm \varphi, \pm 2). \notag
    \end{equation}
    Here \(\varphi = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2\) is the golden ration.
    Note that the first coordinates here, permutations of \((\pm 2, \pm 2, 0, 0)\), are a (scaled) \(24\)-cell.
    
    The other Dynkin types can still be realised as the symmetries of non-regular polytopes.
    However, these tend to be very complicated (not helped by the fact that the rank of the Dynkin diagram corresponds to the dimension of the shape), and are typically constructed especially for the purpose of having the specified symmetries.
    For example, one shape with its symmetry corresponding to \(\E[6]\) is the so-called \(2_{21}\)-polytope.
    This is a \(6\)-dimensional shape which is constructed by taking \(W(\E[6])\), acting as reflections of \(\reals^6\) and then taking the orbit of a nonzero point under this group to define the vertices of the polytope.
    This method will work for generating a polytope with any given reflection symmetry group.
    
    \section{Root Systems}
    Given a vector, \(\alpha \in V \setminus 0\), we've constructed a hyperplane, \(H_\alpha \subset V\).
    We have then considered reflections in this hyperplane.
    We can go the other way.
    Given a reflection, \(s \in \orthogonal(V)\), we can recover the hyperplane as
    \begin{equation}
        H_\alpha = \Fix(s) = \ker(s - \id_{\reals^n})
    \end{equation}
    where \(\Fix(f)\) denotes the fixed points of the map \(f\).
    We can then pick any vector orthogonal to the hyperplane to be \(\alpha\), and this determines \(\alpha\) up to a scalar factor.
    To get a unique identification instead of \(\alpha\) we might consider
    \begin{equation}
        L_\alpha = \reals \alpha = H_\alpha^{\perp}.
    \end{equation}
    Then there is a one-to-one correspondence between reflections and these one-dimensional subspaces of \(\reals^n\).
    
    \begin{remark}{}{}
        The space of one-dimensional subspaces, \(L_\alpha \subset V\), is the Grassmannian \(\Gr(1, n)\), or equivalently, the projective space, \(\projective^{n-1}\).
        Either of these interpretations comes naturally equipped with extra structure that we can exploit.
        These objects will come back later.
    \end{remark}
    
    The orthogonal group, \(\orthogonal(V)\), acts on \(V\) by definition.
    It also acts on itself by conjugation.
    The following shows that these operations are actually equivalent when we restrict to acting on reflections.
    
    \begin{lma}{}{}
        Given \(w \in \orthogonal(V)\) and \(\alpha \in V \setminus 0\) we have \(ws_\alpha w^{-1} = s_{w(\alpha)}\).
        \begin{proof}
            We simply have to check that \(ws_\alpha w^{-1}\) sends \(w(\alpha)\) to its negative and fixes \(H_{w(\alpha)}\).
            First, we have
            \begin{align}
                ws_{\alpha}w^{-1}(w(\alpha)) = ws_\alpha(\alpha) = w(-\alpha) = -w(\alpha).
            \end{align}
            Second, \(\lambda \in H_\alpha\) if and only if \(w(\lambda) \in H_{w(\alpha)}\), since \(\lambda \in H_\alpha\) means \(\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda} = 0\) and \(w(\lambda) \in H_{w(\alpha)}\) means \(\innerprod{w(\alpha)}{w(\lambda)} = 0\), and by the definition of an orthogonal transformation \(\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda} = \innerprod{w(\alpha)}{w(\lambda)}\).
            Then, if \(\lambda \in H_\alpha\), so \(\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda} = 0\), we have
            \begin{equation}
                ws_\alpha w^{-1}(w(\lambda)) = ws_\alpha(\lambda) = w\left( \lambda - 2\frac{\innerprod{\alpha}{\lambda}}{\innerprod{\alpha}{\alpha}}\alpha \right) = w(\lambda).
            \end{equation}
            Thus, elements of \(H_{w(\alpha)}\), which are of the form \(w(\lambda)\) for \(\lambda \in H_\alpha\), are fixed pointwise by \(ws_\alpha w^{-1}\).
        \end{proof}
    \end{lma}
    
    \begin{crl}{}{}
        There is a natural action of a reflection group, \(W\), on the collection of lines \(\{L_\alpha \mid s_\alpha \in W\}\) given by \(w \action L_\alpha = L_{w(\alpha)}\).
    \end{crl}
    
    This action on \(\{L_\alpha \mid s_\alpha \in W\}\) is simply permuting the lines in some way.
    To study this action we don't need to look at the whole line, \(L_\alpha\), instead, we can just take the two unit vectors which lie in this line.
    The collection of all such unit vectors, called a root system, arises in lots of fields of mathematics.
    The case of the regular pentagon is shown in \cref{fig:regular pentagon root system}.
    Notice that we get one root in each region given by splitting along the reflection planes.
    These regions are known as \define{Weyl chambers}.

    \begin{dfn}{Root System (Explicit)}{}
        The \define{root system} of a finite reflection group, \(W\), is the set
        \begin{equation}
            \Phi(W) = \{\beta \in V \mid s_\beta \in W \text{ and } \abs{\beta} = 1\}.
        \end{equation}
    \end{dfn}
    
    \begin{remark}{}{}
        This definition is for a root system as it arises in the study of Coxeter groups.
        In other areas of maths it's preferable to take non-unit vectors so that certain quantities take integer values.
        These non-unit-vector root systems are referred to as \define{crystallographic} root systems.
    \end{remark}
    
    We call the definition above an explicit root system.
    This distinguishes it from the following definition of an \enquote{abstract} root system.
    It turns out that after normalisation every abstract root system corresponds to an explicit root system, and vice versa, so the distinction isn't important.
    The fact that root systems (and hence Dynkin diagrams) appear in so many areas of maths is mostly due to the fact that abstract root systems appear in many areas of maths, and this in turn is explained by their nature as a fairly natural way of arranging a small number of vectors in a very symmetric way.
    
    \begin{dfn}{Root System (Abstract)}{}
        A finite set, \(\Phi \subseteq V \setminus 0\) is an abstract \define{root system} if for all \(\alpha \in \Phi\) we have
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \(\Phi \cap \reals \alpha = \{\pm \alpha\}\) (that is, the only scalar multiples of \(\alpha\) which are included in \(\Phi\) are \(\pm \alpha\));
            \item \(s_\alpha(\Phi) = \Phi\) (so \(s_\alpha\) acts by permuting roots).
        \end{itemize}
    \end{dfn}
    
    The correspondence between a reflection group, \(W\), and its root system, \(\Phi\), goes both ways.
    Given a root system, \(\Phi\), we can define the finite reflection group
    \begin{equation}
        W(\Phi) = \langle s_\alpha \mid \alpha \in \Phi \rangle.
    \end{equation}
    We then recover the (normalised) root system as
    \begin{equation}
        \Phi(W(\Phi)) = \left\{ \frac{\beta}{\abs{\beta}} \,\middle\vert\, \beta \in \Phi \right\}.
    \end{equation}
    
    \section{Simple and Positive Roots}
    It turns out that even a root system contains far more information than is needed.
    To start with, if \(\alpha\) is a root, so is \(-\alpha\).
    So, we can throw away half of the roots.
    It doesn't really matter which half we choose, as long as we keep one of each \(\pm\) pair.
    This defines the \enquote{positive} roots.
    
    \begin{dfn}{Positive Roots}{}
        Consider a root system, \(\Phi\), in the ambient space \(V\).
        Let \(H \subset V\) be a generic hyperplane through the origin.
        By this we mean that \(H \cap \Phi = \emptyset\).
        Choose one side of \(H\), and define this side to be \(H^+\).
        We call \(\Pi = \Phi \cap H^+\) the \define{positive roots}.
    \end{dfn}
    
    While there are two choices made here (the hyperplane, and which side is positive) it turns out that these choices don't matter in practice.
    That is, any other valid choice simply results in isomorphic structures, and so we usually just make some choice that is easiest to work with.
    
    \Cref{fig:regular pentagon positive roots} shows one choice of positive roots for the regular pentagon.

        \label{fig:regular pentagon positive roots}
    \end{figure}
    
    For many purposes there's still more information in the positive roots than we need.
    For example, if we look at \cref{fig:regular pentagon positive roots} for many purposes it's sufficient to take the two extremal roots closest to the hyperplane \(H\).
    A set of roots that contains the information these have is called a simple root system, or a set of simple roots.
    
    \begin{dfn}{Simple Roots}{}
        Let \(\Phi\) be a root system with chosen positive roots, \(\Pi\).
        We call \(\Delta \subseteq \Pi\) a set of simple roots if it generates the cone
        \begin{equation}
            \mathop{\operatorname{cone}} \Pi = \sum_{\beta \in \Pi} \reals_+ \beta.
        \end{equation}
    \end{dfn}
    
    The cone consists of all vectors which can be written as a linear combination of positive roots with positive coefficients.
    For the pentagon this cone, as well as the two simple roots, are shown in \cref{fig:regular pentagon simple roots}.

    In this two dimensional space we have two simple roots, and that is, in general, as far as we can go without losing information.
    Note that the simple roots don't contain \emph{all} of the information, we still have to remember which positive linear combinations of the simple roots we allow to generate all positive roots, which we can then reflect through the origin to produce the negative roots.
    The simple roots are still an important subset containing much of the needed information though.
