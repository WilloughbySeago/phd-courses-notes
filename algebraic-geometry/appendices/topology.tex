\chapter{Topology}
Here we collect some results from topology which we'll make use of in the course.
This won't be very well organised, and is more for reference than actual reading.
The conditions to be included here are pretty much \enquote{I had to look it up} or \enquote{I had to think about it for more than 10 seconds} while writing these notes, or \enquote{I thought it was worth recapping}.

\section{Results}

\begin{lma}{}{lma:hausdorff iff diagonal closed}
    Let \(X\) be a topological space.
    Then \(X\) is Hausdorff if and only if
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta = \{(x, x) \mid x \in X\}
    \end{equation}
    is a closed subset of \(X \times X\) with the product topology.
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose that \(\Delta\) is closed.
        Let \(x, y \in X\) be distinct points.
        We look for open sets, \(U, V \subseteq X\), such that \(x \in U\), \(y \in V\) and \(U \cap V = \emptyset\).
        To do so consider the point \(p = (x, y) \in X \times X\).
        Since \(x \ne y\) we know that \(p \notin \Delta\), and so \(p \in (X \times X) \setminus \Delta\), which is an open set by assumption.
        The product topology on \(X \times X\) is generated by sets of the form \(U \times V\) with open sets, \(U, V \subseteq X\).
        Specifically, this means that there must be some choice of such a \(U\) and \(V\) with \(p \in U \times V \subseteq (X \times X) \setminus \Delta\).
        Since \(p \in U \times V\) we know that \(x \in U\) and \(y \in V\).
        If \(U\) and \(V\) are not disjoint we can always take open neighbourhoods, \(U' \subseteq U\) and \(V' \subseteq V\), containing \(x\) and \(y\) respectively, which are disjoint, which then separate \(x\) and \(y\) showing that \(X\) is Hausdorff.
        
        Suppose instead that \(X\) is Hausdorff.
        We will show that \((X \times X) \setminus \Delta\) is open.
        To do so we show that any \(p \in (X \times X) \setminus \Delta\) has an open neighbourhood disjoint from \(\Delta\).
        We know that \(p \in X \times X\), so \(p = (x, y)\) for some \(x, y \in X\), and since \(p \notin \Delta\) we know that \(x \ne y\).
        Then since \(X\) is Hausdorff there exist disjoint open sets, \(U, V \subseteq X\), such that \(x \in U\) and \(y \in V\) and then \(p = (x, y) \in U \times V\), and so \(U \times V\) is an open neighbourhood of \(P\), and since \(U\) and \(V\) are disjoint \(U \times V \cap \Delta = \emptyset\).
    \end{proof}
