\chapter{Commutative Algebra}
Here we collect some results from topology which we'll make use of in the course.
This won't be very well organised, and is more for reference than actual reading.
The conditions to be included here are pretty much \enquote{I had to look it up} or \enquote{I had to think about it for more than 10 seconds} while writing these notes, or \enquote{I thought it was worth recapping}.

\section{Results}

\begin{lma}{}{}
    Let \(X\) be a topological space.
    Then \(X\) is Hausdorff if and only if
    \begin{equation}
        \Delta = \{(x, x) \mid x \in X\}
    \end{equation}
    is a closed subset of \(X \times X\) with the product topology.
